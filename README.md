# Sentiment Analysis using NLTK - VADER

This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using the **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** model provided by the **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** library.

## Overview

VADER is a pre-built, lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It is capable of detecting the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and the sentiment intensity of text.

## Features

- Simple and fast implementation.
- Ideal for social media texts like tweets, reviews, and comments.
- Provides sentiment scores: Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Compound.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-vader.git
cd sentiment-analysis-vader


Install the required packages:
pip install nltk


Download VADER lexicon from NLTK:
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the VADER model:

from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import nltk

# Download the VADER lexicon if not already done
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Example text
text = "I love this product! It's amazing and works great."

# Get sentiment scores
scores = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)

print("Sentiment Scores:", scores)


Example Output:
Sentiment Scores: {
    'neg': 0.0,
    'neu': 0.315,
    'pos': 0.685,
    'compound': 0.8316
}

Interpretation of Scores
pos: Probability of positive sentiment.

neu: Probability of neutral sentiment.

neg: Probability of negative sentiment.

compound: Normalized, weighted composite score:

Range from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).

Common thresholds:

compound >= 0.05: Positive

compound <= -0.05: Negative

Otherwise: Neutral
